## Handshaking lemma: the sum of the degrees in a graph is twice the number if its vertices

A *simple graph* `G = (V, E)` is defined by its set of *vertices (nodes)* `V` and
a set of *edges* `∅ ⊆ E ⊆ { e = {u, v} ∣ u ≠ v ∈ V }`. It is *finite* if `V` is
finite and its *order* denotes `#V` and *size* denotes `#E`.

The edges can also be interpreted as a relationship `~` between vertices,
where `u ~ v` if and only if `{u, v} ∈ E` (which in particular implies that
`u ≠ v`). Two vertices defining an edge are said to be *adjacent* and an edge
and any of its two vertices are said to be *incident*.

The *neighborhood* of a vertex `v` is defined as `N(v) = {u | u ~ v}`. Its
*degree* `d(v) = #N(v)` is simply the cardinality of its neighbordhood.
The *incidence set* of a vertex `v` is defined as `I(V) = {e ∈ E | v ∈ e}`.

**Handshake Lemma.** Given any finite simple graph `G = (V, E)`, the sum of the
degrees of all its vertices equals twice its size, that is `Σ_v d(v) = 2 * #E`.
